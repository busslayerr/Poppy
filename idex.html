    <h3>Northern California</h3>
     <p>My favorite stop in Northern California was Mount Shasta. There was a great (but expensive) burger place called Yak's, which was the only thing I ate for the two days I stayed there.The scenery was beautiful, yet deserted of people. All the stores looked like a barren Costco during the pandemic.<br>Other than expensive burgers, I had a near-death experience where I  went mountainbiking in Lake Siskiyou with a regular street bike. I got lost in the forest, fell into a ditch, and still had to trek about 15 miles back to the hotel room. I still have the scars from falling into a ditch 3 months ago, but it was a memorable experience. I think everyone should get lost in the woods at least once in their life just for experience.</p>
