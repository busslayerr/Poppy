    <h3>Northern California</h3>
     <p>My favorite stop in Northern California was Mount Shasta. There was a great (but expensive) burger place called Yak's, which was the only thing I ate for the two days I stayed there.The scenery was beautiful, yet deserted of people. All the stores looked like a barren Costco during the pandemic.<br>Other than expensive burgers, I had a near-death experience where I  went mountainbiking in Lake Siskiyou with a regular street bike. I got lost in the forest, fell into a ditch, and still had to trek about 15 miles back to the hotel room. I still have the scars from falling into a ditch 3 months ago, but it was a memorable experience. I think everyone should get lost in the woods at least once in their life just for experience.</p>

    <h3>Oregon</h3>
    <p>On the way to Washington, we first stopped at Bend. By far it is my favorite place in America. I went mountainbiking there and also drove out to see Crater Lake, which was still snowing in the middle of the summer.The only thing I brang on this roadtrip were tanktops and shorts so I was freezing.<br>On the way back home, I stopped at Tillamook to eat cheese and ice cream (even though I'm lactose intolerant). Tillamook is this rural city by the ocean. It was super duper cold and everyhwere I went was overemployed with bored teenagers with nothing else to do. It was beautiful, though.</p>
